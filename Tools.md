This project was developed using Cursor.

I've been using Next.js lately and one of the goals for me was to refresh my knowledge on a few libraries: ChakraUI + Tanstack Query & Router in an SPA setup.

Cursor helped understand how to quickly set up these libraries, make them work together and help me quickly debug errors.

Also, it helped set up the UI to be responsive and very easy to set up with Chakra components.
